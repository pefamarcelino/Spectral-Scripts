# Mr. Snacks' Diary

*December, 202X*

Well, here's the grand finale, or should I say, the grand flop. Tried being a writer, but the world just wasn't ready for a guy who brought AI to the literary party. Got ghosted by every publishing house in town.

Decided to unleash my brainchild into the wild web. Dumped it in the darkest corners of the deep web, hoping it would haunt the digital alleyways like a ghost. Maybe someone, someday, will stumble upon these forsaken files.

Consider me done with being a wordsmith. I'm letting this ship sink to the bottom of the internet ocean. Maybe some fool will find it in the wreckage and think, "What the heck is this?" I'm out.
